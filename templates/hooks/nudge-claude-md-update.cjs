The "## Current State" section in CLAUDE.md is empty. Before this context is compacted, consider updating it with:
- Active work in progress (bead IDs, what's being built)
- Recent architectural decisions or trade-offs made
- Known issues or blockers discovered
- Key files or patterns identified during investigation

This information will persist across sessions and help future investigations.

Update with: Edit CLAUDE.md → add content under "## Current State"

- "## Current State" for active work and decisions
- "## Project Overview" if project scope became clearer
- "## Tech Stack" if new technologies were discovered
